# Reflection for Assignment 1

Their main aesthetic that they use when making slide presentations for their meetings, as well as their social media posts has inspired and influenced how I designed and planned this website for them. 
I also went up to them at their meeting to ask some basic questions and also reached out to the president via Instagram to send photos of a potential color palette.
While reviewing my drafts, the only change they wanted was for the ASA page to have the About Section on the homepage, and the e-board to be in its own section.
They requested the same for PGA in terms of their leaders, since there are 2 leaders of PGA.
